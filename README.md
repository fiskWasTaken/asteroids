# Asteroids

(WIP) Simple C++/SFML Asteroids clone.

Features:

* Joystick and keyboard support
* Automatic controller detection
* SAT (Separating Axis Theorem) collision engine
* 3 levels (probably crashes after that right now)
* A ship that can shoot things
* Multiplayer
* Variable-sized rocks with funky shapes to take advantage of SAT
